In 1770 he entered the military orphanage, which two years later became the military academy and in 1781 the Milit\u00e4r-Hochschule. Here Dieter received an excellent free education, but in return had to pledge his life to the service of the Duke of W\u00fcrttemberg. His initial training was in painting, but as his musical gifts became increasingly evident he was soon destined for a musical career. From members of the court orchestra he learnt various instruments, especially the violin but also the viola, flute and bassoon. He studied composition briefly with the court Kapellmeister Antonio Boroni, and later with his successor Agostino Poli. Duke Karl Eugen believed in the importance of a thorough general education, and Dieter's specialized musical studies were supplemented by history, geography, languages and other subjects. He was a diligent student, excelling as a violinist and composer and frequently winning prizes; in 1779 his first German opera, Der Schulze im Dorfe, was performed with great success in the presence of the duke. But he disliked the strict discipline of the court and tried to run away in the spring of 1780; for this he was imprisoned in Ludwigsburg, but was pardoned after declaring his acquiescence to the duke's wishes. On 25 July 1781 Dieter was appointed Hofmusicus as first violinist in the court orchestra. The stipend was meagre, and as he eventually had a family of 11 children, he remained poor to the end of his life. He retired in 1817.\n\nDieter began his career in Stuttgart ten years after the departure of Niccol\u00f2 Jommelli, and although German Singspiel had by then begun to predominate over the Italian opera, Dieter\u2019s works show that he was familiar with Jommelli's operas as well as with Hiller's Singspiels. His librettos follow Hiller's, \u2018reflecting the Biedermeier quality of the time\u2019 (Hermann Abert); his music exhibits features of both styles, especially in Belmont und Constanze (whose popularity was said to have been responsible for the very late arrival of Mozart's Die Entf\u00fchrung aus dem Serail on the Stuttgart stage, in 1795). His most characteristic numbers are simple folklike songs, intimate or gay, which stand in marked contrast to the pathos of the bravura italianate arias given mostly to characters of high social standing. But Dieter's concern was not generally with dramatic characterization; he was particularly successful in the musical depiction of dramatic, and especially comic, situations, making use of varied orchestral colour in the manner of Jommelli. Abert has traced evidence of Mozart's influence in his later works. Dieter's horizons and influence were limited to his native locality, where he enjoyed great popularity: in 1802 Stuttgart audiences still looked forward eagerly to the last of his dozen operas, Des Teufels Lustschloss. His instrumental works were likewise popular (a critic reviewing some pieces for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung described them as \u2018agreeable and jolly\u2019), and his church works, though not notable, were performed throughout W\u00fcrttemberg. His importance lies in his having established the Singspiel in his part of Germany, and for the short period of his activity he gave the genre a picturesque quality that was characteristically his own.",

Allegro (C major)\n05:57 2. La Roxelane. Allegretto (o pi\u00f9 tosto allegro) (C minor \u2013 C major)\n12:33 3. Minuet \u2013 Trio (C major)\n16:42 4. Finale. Presto (C major)\n\nThe Symphony No. 63 in C major, Hoboken I/63, is a symphony by Joseph Haydn written sometime between 1779 and 1781. It is often known by the title of the second movement, La Roxelane, named for Roxelana, the influential wife of Suleiman the Magnificent of the Ottoman Empire. This second movement was originally part of Haydn's incidental music for Charles Simon Favart's stage work Soliman der zweite (or Les Trois Sultanes) in which Roxelana was a character.\n\nThere are two versions of this symphony: the so-called \"first version\" is scored for flute, two oboes, two bassoons, two horns, two trumpets, timpani, and strings, while the \"second version\" has the same scoring but with only one bassoon and no trumpets or timpani. Part of the reason for this rescoring was the departure of bassoonist Ignatz Drobny from Eszterh\u00e1za, leaving Haydn's orchestra with only one bassoon.\n\nThe two versions are not only differently scored; the third and fourth movements of the two versions are also totally different. The first version of the finale is based on an old fragment from c. 1769\u201373 and is viewed by some musicologists as a stop-gap to perhaps complete the symphony early to fulfill the need for a performance.",

Jules Barbier and Michel Carr\u00e9\u2019s libretto is a tale of romance, temptation, and the age-old battle between satanic powers and religion. It is based on Carr\u00e9\u2019s play Faust et Marguerite, which in turn is based on Part I of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe\u2019s dramatic poem Faust, one of the great works of European literature.\n\nDavid McVicar\u2019s lavish production, first seen in 2004, sets the action in the Paris of Gounod\u2019s later years, on the eve of the Franco-Prussian War. Charles Edwards\u2019s designs include a memorable Cabaret d\u2019Enfer and an impressive reconstruction of the Church of Saint-S\u00e9verin. They vividly convey the clash between religion and hedonistic entertainment, and provide a powerful backdrop to Gounod\u2019s score. Faust contains much-loved musical highlights including the memorable Soldiers\u2019 Chorus, M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s\u2019s rowdy \u2018Song of the Golden Calf\u2019, and Marguerite\u2019s Jewel Song with its dazzling coloratura. The opera\u2019s final scene includes an impassioned trio between Faust, Marguerite and M\u00e9phistoph\u00e9l\u00e8s, as Marguerite struggles to resist temptation and gain salvation.",

On 1 November 1864 the 21-year-old 'Pretender' to the Waltz King's throne, Carl Michael Ziehrer, conducted the first performance of his waltz Tanz-Br\u00fcder (Dancing Brothers, op. 28) at a concert in Vienna's Dianabad-Saal. Ziehrer's publisher, Carl Haslinger - who was formerly the Strauss brothers' publisher before an altercation separated the parties - duly announced the piano edition of the work a month later, on 3 December 1864. Is it conceivable that the title of Ziehrer's waltz sparked an idea in the inventive mind of the ever-resourceful Johann Strauss, resulting in the startling announcement which appeared in the Neue Freie Presse on 19 December 1864: \"The Strauss brothers are composing a 'Trifolien-Walzer' for the 'Hesperus Ball' on 13 February [1865] in the Dianasaal\". All three Strauss brothers were members of the Vienna Artists' Association, 'Hesperus', and although Johann and Josef had each separately contributed music to previous 'Hesperus' festivities, Trifolien marked the very first occasion on which Johann, Josef and Eduard had collaborated on a single work. On 15 February 1865, two days after the 'Hesperus Ball', the Fremden-Blatt remarked that the new Strauss waltz had received \"lively applause\" at its premi\u00e8re, the conducting of which had fallen to the youngest brother, Eduard, at the head of the Strauss Orchestra. The first public performance of the Trifolien Walzer followed on Sunday 19 February 1865, when the Strauss Orchestra played it at a concert given by Johann, Josef and Eduard Strauss in the Vienna Volksgarten. The inside cover of the dance cards issued at the 'Hesperus Ball' pictured a \"really charming drawing of three gnomes endeavouring to entice music from a double bass\", one astride the upper bouts (shoulders) of the instrument while the other two operate the bow. Perhaps mirroring the order in which the Strauss brothers' contributions appear in the composition, the unnamed artist has positioned the three gnomes in descending order of age. It was presumably this same piece of artwork which adorned the first piano edition of the Trifolien Walzer which the C.A. Spina publishing house delivered to the music dealers on 17 February 1865. The waltz bears the composers' dedication \"To the Artists' Association, Hesperus\". In composing the Trifolien Walzer, the brothers chose to divide the workload fairly equally amongst themselves: Johann provided Waltz No. 1, Josef Waltz No. 2 and Eduard furnished not only Waltz No. 3 but also the Introduction and the cleverly-contrived Coda. The three-part waltz was probably short: as Johann Strauss recounted much later, the Trifolien Walzer presented to the publisher C.A. Spina was too short and the brothers were required to extend their own contributions. This would explain the untypical waltz form of Trifolien, with each of the three waltz sections possessing a trio. A particularly fascinating aspect of Trifolien is that it affords the listener the opportunity to judge the very different compositional style each brother stamped on his music. The title of the waltz derives from the Latin noun Trifolium, meaning 'a three-leafed herb', but here specifically referring to the three-leafed clover, Trifolium pratense. The allusion is therefore made between the trifoliate leaves of the clover and this tripartite collaboration by the Strauss brothers.\n\nDon't forget to subscribe and leave a comment, that would be helpful to improve my channel.

        "description": "Cyril Scott (1879 - 1970), Early One Morning for piano and orchestra (1930 - 1931, rev. 1962)\n\nPerformed by Howard Shelley (piano), BBC Philharmonic Orchestra cond. Martyn Brabbins\n\nScott was essentially a late romantic composer, whose style was at the same time strongly influenced by impressionism. His harmony was notably exotic. If in his early works it was perhaps over-sweet (Alban Berg dismissed his music as 'mushy'), it became steadily more varied and more refined in his later years. Indeed it is his late works (written between 1950 and his death) that are the most individual, with their ever-shifting harmonic colours and wayward inflections of phrase and mood, capturing perfectly the way the mind shifts, backwards and forwards, between reminiscence, regrets, and self-assertion.\n\nScott wrote around four hundred works (though the number is deceptive, since more than half of these were short songs or piano pieces). These include two mature symphonies, three operas, three piano concertos, concertos for violin, cello, oboe and harpsichord, and three double concertos (of which the scores are now lost), several overtures, four oratorios (Nativity Hymn (1913), Mystic Ode (1932), Ode to Great Men (1936), and Hymn of Unity (1947), as well as a mass of chamber music (four mature quartets, five violin sonatas, three piano trios, and many others). Between 1903 and 1920 Scott wrote copiously for the piano. Most of these pieces were harmonically adventurous for their time and easy to play; they circulated widely in many countries of the world, in contrast to his more ambitious works, none of which received more than a handful of performances.\n\nScott was called the \"Father of modern British music\" by Eugene Goossens, and was also appreciated by Claude Debussy, Maurice Ravel, his close friend Percy Grainger, Richard Strauss and Igor Stravinsky. His experiments in free rhythm, generated by expanding musical motifs, above all in his First Piano Sonata of 1909, appear to have exerted an influence on Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring. He used to be known as 'the English Debussy', though this reflected little knowledge of Scott and little understanding of Debussy.\n\nFor most of us, acquainted (if at all) with his many piano encores, his chamber music and early orchestral works, Cyril Scott was a composer of the first quarter of the twentieth century, and he is certainly a potent instance of a once flamboyant figure, writing at the cutting edge of modernism, who later found that the world had passed him by. Unsympathetic to the idioms that came to prevail after the First World War, Scott no longer connected with the musical establishment. Yet for all that, he went on composing with a personal vision which is only unfamiliar to us because his later big orchestral works have not been heard.\n\nA single-movement work for piano and orchestra, Early One Morning was composed in 1930 \u2013 31 and published in a reduction for two pianos. It is not clear whether it was performed in the composer\u2019s lifetime; a performance reputed to have been given by Dan Godfrey at Bournemouth cannot be documented. The piece is based on the traditional tune \u2018Early One Morning\u2019.\n\nThe composer described the music as very ethereal in character, yet totally unlike the ethereality of Debussy even in his most subtle vein. Moreover, it possesses the spontaneity of an improvisation and might be so termed were it not for its distinct though somewhat unusual form. Many of the figurations in the solo part will be familiar from his piano pieces. \n\nScott left a typescript programme note pasted on the score (it is now in the Percy Grainger Museum at the University of Melbourne, and reprinted here with permission), which reads as follows:\n\nThe Poem opens atmospherically on the strings with a melodic and subdued phrase alternating between 7 / 8 and 5 / 8 time. It suggests the quiet mood of sunrise on a peaceful summer morning when there is just a slight haze. Presently the piano enters with arpeggios on an unusual chord (characteristic of the composer\u2019s later style) and followed by cascade-like fi gures which joyously create the impression of songful birds: the piano is supported by a sustained chord on the orchestra. A few bars of the opening phrase are then repeated (orchestra alone), after which there is a solo passage for piano built on the first phrase but accentuating the joyous mood. This leads to a modification of the well-known air Early One Morning, given out on the oboe. Finally the piano takes up the air in its original form, though with novel and ingenious harmonies. It then goes through various transformations and developments, during which the opening phrase is again heard. Eventually after a considerable crescendo a climax is reached, then gradually there is a simmering-down amid a repetition of the cascade-like figures. The work ends poetically on a pianissimo.",

Walk the body!\nLisa Lisa, Lisa Lisa\nI know this feeling\nOh it's hurting, just because love is growing\nOh ah ah, please don't stop\nIt must be love\nSomething's jumpin, it must be love\nSomething's jumpin! Jumpin in your shirt\nThe pain it really hurts\nSomething's jumpin, it must be love\nSomething's jumpin! Jumpin in your shirt\nThe pain it really hurts\nNo matter what I do\nNo matter what I say\nThe boys see me in a whole new way\nIt's different now, they're all love bound\nBut I don't like love,\nI kick it around, I kick it around\nBut I felt something hurting\nAnd the boys said\nThere's something jumpin!\nJumpin in your shirt\nWalk the body! Walk the body!\nLisa Lisa, Lisa Lisa\nI know this feeling\nOh it's hurting, just because love is growing\nOh ah ah, please don't stop\nIt must be love\nI've got courage and I feel brave\nIf those boys try to hurt me\nI'll end their happy day\nJump!\nIt must be love\nThere's something jumpin! Jumpin in your shirt\nSomething's jumpin\nIt must be love\nJump!\nIt must be love",

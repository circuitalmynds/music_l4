Shot in a disused warehouse in Wardour Street London, March 1983. Filmed by Howard Guard (who also directed the iconic Maxell tape advertisements), the end sequence of the band asleep in the back of the limousine was, according to Guard, very much for real. Finally wrapped up as dawn was breaking through. Poignant message with the scattered sleeves....single taken from the album Burning From The Inside.
